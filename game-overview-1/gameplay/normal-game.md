### Matchmaking System Process

The system deducts the participation fee and searches for up to 4 players to join a match. Players will be grouped into a game during the search, even with only 2 players. Matchmaking lasts up to 30 seconds. If no match is found after 30 seconds, the match will be canceled.

Each player has a maximum of 3 slots to equip items to bring into the game.

### Game Rules

* Each player controls their character and places bombs around the map for 5 minutes.
* Bomb Explosion Mechanics:

1. Bombs explode upon contact with obstacles or other players.
2. Indestructible Obstacles: Bombs are blocked and cannot explode through these obstacles.
3. Destructible Obstacles: When hit by a bomb, these obstacles disappear and may drop items or tokens.

* Interaction with Other Players:

1. Players hit by bomb explosions will be eliminated.
2. The match ends when only one player remains or when 3 minutes have passed. If no winner is determined after 3 minutes, all remaining players will be awarded equal rankings.

* End of Match Rewards:

1. Players receive rewards in the form of EXP and Gems.
2. At the end of the match, the system will distribute Gem rewards based on the number of players and each player's final ranking.

### Item Usage

* Players can obtain items by destroying obstacles. In each match, players can collect up to 3 items, which will be displayed in 3 item slots.

1. Item Limitations:

* Items cannot be stacked.
* Once all 3 slots are filled, no additional items can be picked up.

2. How to Use Items:

* Players press Ctrl to select an item, with each item numbered from 1 to 3 and highlighted when selected.
* Press Space to activate the selected item.
* Items collected during the match will be displayed in the player's profile.
