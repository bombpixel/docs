# How to recharge Hourglass?

#### **Recharge Mechanics**

* **Only exhausted Hourglasses can be recharged.**
* Players use **Sand** to recharge an Hourglass.
* Workshop rarity can fully recharge Hourglasses of equal or lower rarity.
* Players need to sign an **on-chain transaction** for recharging.

{% hint style="info" %}
Sand + Exhausted Hourglass + Rare Workshop = Full Rare/Common/Uncommon Hourglass
