At **BombPixel**, our economy is designed to **empower players** by allowing them to **craft, trade, and earn** within an open ecosystem. Instead of a **centralized in-game store** selling items directly, BombPixel enables players to **generate value through gameplay**, reinforcing a **sustainable and decentralized economic model**.

Unlike traditional free-to-play economies, where **game studios sell items directly**, BombPixel provides a **crafting and resource-driven system** where players can actively **create and trade valuable assets**.

### **How the Economy Works**

The BombPixel economy is structured around key components:

#### **1.** [**Workshops & Crafting**](economy-components/workshops.md)

* **Workshops** serve as the **core production hubs** where players can **craft valuable assets**.
* Players **use resources like Sand and Empty Hourglasses** to craft **new Hourglasses**, which are essential for earning in-game.
* Higher-level **Workshops** allow crafting of **higher-rarity Hourglasses**, increasing their earning potential.

#### **2.** [**Hourglasses**](economy-components/hourglass/)**: The Core Earning Mechanism**

* **Hourglasses** dictate the amount of **play-to-earn time** available to a player.
* They can be **crafted, upgraded, and recharged** within the ecosystem.
* Higher-rarity Hourglasses provide **longer earning durations**, making them more valuable in the marketplace.

#### **3.** [**Gameplay & GEM Rewards**](economy-components/gem/)

* Players **engage in BombPixel’s gameplay**, utilizing their Hourglasses to **earn GEMs**.
* GEMs serve as the **primary in-game currency**, used for **purchasing hero equipment** and other in-game upgrades.
* Once the **Token Generation Event (TGE)** occurs, GEMs can be **converted into the project’s native token**, providing real-world value.

#### **4. Sustainable Economic Model**

* **No Pay-to-Win Mechanics** – Items are **crafted by players**, not sold by the game.
* **Player-Centric Marketplace** – Players **trade crafted Hourglasses and items** on an open marketplace.
* **Limited Supply & Burning Mechanisms** – The game ensures **balanced resource management**, preventing inflation.
