2. Earning GEM from Daily Check-in

Players can receive an amount of gems for staying online. There are milestones for the reward and the more time players stay on the game, the more gems they will receive. We feel like this is the reward for players who spend lots of time in the game and itâ€™s a way for us to pay a tribute to them.

3. Earning GEM from Weekly Challenges

Players looking for more challenges other than casual gameplay can participate in weekly challenges. Finishing these challenges will grant these players with stars. Earning enough stars for a milestone, players will receive a chest. Opening these chests will grant players with gems or items.

In Jackpot, players spin 3 wheels consisting of symbols. If players land 2 identical symbols, there will be a cash out. But if players land on 3 identical symbols, there would be a big cashout, and the reward can go up to 50,000 gems.

5. Earning GEM from Vote

Everytime an event starts, players will receive a popup showing in game. Players will be able to enter events using gems and will receive a fascinating prize. In every game, the game will provide a question for the players to choose between the 2 answers, which answer got more votes will be the correct answer.

Players can choose how many gems they want to spend to play. If they choose wrong, they will lose all gems. If they win, they receive an amount of gems scaling with the gems they spent.
