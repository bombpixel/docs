2. Earning GEM from Daily Check-in

Players can receive an amount of gems for staying online. There are milestones for the reward and the more time players stay on the game, the more gems they will receive. We feel like this is the reward for players who spend lots of time in the game and itâ€™s a way for us to pay a tribute to them.
