# How to craft Hourglass?

1. [**Workshop**](../workshops.md) **Rarity Restriction**

A **Workshop can only craft Hourglasses of equal or lower rarity**.

> A **Rare Workshop** can craft **Common, Uncommon, and Rare Hourglasses** but **not Epic or higher**.

2. **Two Crafting Methods**

* **Upgrade by Combining 3 Hourglasses**
  * To craft an **Hourglass of higher rarity**, players need **three Hourglasses of the same lower rarity**.
  * Additionally, they must own a **Workshop with a rarity equal to the target Hourglass**.
  * Hourglasses must be **fully charged** and **not currently equipped**.
  * **On-chain transaction required** to complete the crafting process.

{% hint style="info" %}
3 Rare Hourglasses + 1 Epic Workshop = 1 Epic Hourglass
{% endhint %}

**Craft from Materials**

* Requires **1 Empty Hourglass + Sand + Workshop**.
* The resulting Hourglass rarity is random but will be **equal to or lower than the Workshop rarity**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Using **1 Empty Hourglass + 1 Sand + Rare Workshop**, players can obtain a **Common, Uncommon, or Rare Hourglass randomly.**
{% endhint %}
