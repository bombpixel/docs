# Ownership

Heroes in Bomb Pixel are NFTs owned by players. Players can obtain heroes from the marketplace, hero packs, special events, or early access. Buying heroes from packs provides a randomly generated hero with varying rarity.

They can buy these packs using $SEI. Owned heroes can be sold on the marketplace and will be disabled, while the rest can be used by the player.
