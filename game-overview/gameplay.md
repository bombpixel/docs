# Gameplay

The core gameplay consists of mechanics of classic bomb games, such as the well-known Bomberman series, typically revolves around strategic placement of bombs to defeat enemies, destroy obstacles, and achieve specific objectives, enhanced with web3 features. Here's a breakdown of the core mechanics:

1. Player Movement: Players navigate a character through a maze-like environment. The movement is usually grid-based, and players can move up, down, left, or right.
2. Bomb Placement: The primary mechanic involves placing bombs on the grid. Once placed, bombs explode after a short delay, affecting the surrounding area. The explosion typically has a blast radius that can destroy walls, enemies, and power-ups within a certain range.
3. Destruction of Obstacles: Bomb pixel features destructible obstacles such as walls or blocks. These obstacles can either hinder the player's progress or hide items like power-ups or keys. Players need to destroy these obstacles to uncover new paths or gain advantages.
4. Defeating Enemies: In some game modes, the objective is to defeat AI-controlled enemies or rival players. The bombs can be used strategically to eliminate enemies, either by direct explosion or by trapping them.
5. Power-ups and Items: Bomb games often feature power-ups that enhance the player's abilities. Common examples include:

* Bomb Range Increase: Increases the radius of explosions.
* Speed Boost: Increases the player's movement speed.
* Bomb Count Increase: Allows players to place more bombs at once.
* Shield: Temporarily protects the player from bomb damage.
* Reduced Detonation: Allows bombs to detonate faster.
* Sensored Bomb: Allows players to place a bomb with a sensor
* Purify: Automatically removes a stun for the player.
* Bomb Gloves: Disable a planted bomb.

6. Winning Condition: As a player, your aim is to be the last player standing, often by outsmarting others with bomb placement and strategic movement.

Overall, the combination of quick reflexes, strategic thinking, and tactical use of bombs makes Bomb Pixel engaging and fun.
