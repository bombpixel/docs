### Overview

\
Boss Battle is a special game mode available at specific times of the day. Players can join during these times to face off against one of two randomly selected bosses.

### Battle Structure

* Each battle lasts for 3 minutes.
* Players have 3 lives to complete the battle.
* Players must progress through stages to eventually face the final boss.

### Earning Rewards

* Players defeat enemies during the stages to earn Gems. Gems can be used to purchase support items after completing a stage.
* Upon defeating the final boss, players will receive a random amount of Gems (between 1 and 20) and an Item Upgrade Chest.
* Item Upgrade Chest: When opened, this chest grants the player a special item (NFT), which can be used to upgrade their hero.
