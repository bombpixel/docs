### Overview

\
Treasure Hunt is a feature where players explore their land to search for hidden treasures (Gems).

### Land Requirements

\
To participate in the Treasure Hunt, players must own a piece of land. There are three types of land available:

* Small Land
* Medium Land
* Large Land

### Gameplay

* Treasure Hunt mode is available at specific times. Once the mode is active, players control their character to explore and destroy blocks on their land.
* Destroyed blocks have a chance to drop Gems.
* Gems will remain on the map for 5 seconds. If not collected within this time or if hit by a bomb, the Gems will disappear.

### Stamina Mechanics

* Each character has a limited amount of stamina. Movement and exploration consume stamina, and once the stamina is depleted, the character cannot move further.
* The amount of stamina consumed depends on the distance the character travels in the game.
