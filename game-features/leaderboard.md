# Leaderboard

Leaderboard is a list of players ranking top gems earned in-game. The purpose of a leaderboard that shows top earners in a game is to recognize and reward the players who accumulate the most in-game earnings, fostering competition and motivating players to improve their performance. It provides a sense of achievement and status, encourages engagement, and can drive players to continue playing to climb higher on the leaderboard. There are 3 types of leaderboards:

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="411"></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Leaderboard</td><td>Description</td><td>Time</td></tr><tr><td>Season</td><td>Ranking based on gems earned in a season </td><td>1 season </td></tr><tr><td>Weekly</td><td>Ranking based on gems earned in a week</td><td>1 week (reset after 7 days) </td></tr><tr><td>Daily</td><td>Ranking based on gems earned in a day</td><td>1 day (reset after 24h UTC) </td></tr></tbody></table>

To climb a leaderboard in a game that tracks top earners, players need to accumulate as many in-game earnings as possible. This can be achieved by numerous ways that the game provides and players need to set up strategies in order to maximize their earning. The more a player earns through these actions, the higher their rank will be on the leaderboard.
