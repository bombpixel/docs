# Land

Land ownership unlocks advanced features and resource generation:

* [Treasury Hunt](gameplay/treasury-hunt.md): Exclusive game mode for landowners.
* [Custom Maps](custom-map.md): Build, customize, and publish arenas for player votes.

This feature allows players to manage the Lands they own or are renting from other players. Additionally, players can purchase Land here.Only players who owned or rented Lands can play Treasury Hunt. If a player does not own any Land, the system will display the message “Player does not own Land” and direct the player to the page to buy or rent Land. If the player owns or is renting Land, the system will display a list of the player's Lands, including:

* The image of the player's Land
* The name of the Land
* The Land's ID code
* Slot: The number of heroes currently relaxing in the Land
* The status of the Land:
  * Owner: The Land is owned by the player
  * Renting: The Land is being rented from another player (with a countdown of the remaining rental days). If the rental period expires, the rented Land will disappear from the list of Lands.

In order to use the feature custom map, you will need to own a land. After owning a land, players can create a custom map by selecting blocks and placing them into the map. After they finish customizing, they can publish the map so people can vote for it if they want it to be an official map.
