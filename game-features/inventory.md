# Inventory

Bomb Pixel's inventory is a system used to store and manage the items or resources players acquire during gameplay. It serves as a central hub where players can view, organize, equip, or use these items.

There are 2 types of items&#x20;

* Items: Consumable equipments that players can carry into matches. These will not be lost if players donâ€™t use them. Players can also buy these types of equipment here. These are not NFTs.
* Crafting items: Items that can upgrade heroes permanently and chests. These chests contain NFT upgrade items that can be sold on marketplaces.

Chests can be open individually. Each time the player opens a chest, they are required to sign on-chain to open it and add it to inventory.
