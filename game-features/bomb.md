# Bomb

When players purchase heroes, they receive a Base Bomb as a bonus. Players can unlock different types of bombs with various stats. Players unlock bombs in the inventory using Gems. Before entering a match, players can choose which bomb to equip. If the player has not unlocked any other bombs, the system will default to equipping the Base Bomb. If the player has unlocked other bombs, they can click to choose which bomb to equip.
